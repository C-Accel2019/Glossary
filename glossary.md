---

_This living document serves as a community and consensus-driven glossary of terms for C-Accel 2019 teams in track A and B with the hope to accelerate convergence on common goals and measures for success. In cases where agreement has not yet been reached or where a plurality of views is beneficial, multiple versions can be maintained and term in a single version may be defined multiple times by indicating which teams utilize them. This will enable teams to interoperate without enforcing a single artificial view._

## Open Knowledge Network (OKN)

It may make sense to distinguish between *open-knowledge* networks and open *knowledge-networks*. The first case implies a social structure that provides the means to make [knowledge]() openly available. The second case, in contrast, describes the structure of the data and the mode of contributions to such structure. To avoid conflicts with the narrower and more technical notion of a [knowledge graph](), we define an open knowledge network in the first sense. An OKN is a network consisting of partners across academia, industry, and the government set out to foster the publication, retrieval, and integration of openly available knowledge. Such a network may also foster a culture of opening up otherwise siloed knowledge.
