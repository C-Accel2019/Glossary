# C-Accel 2019 Glossary

---

_This living document serves as a community and consensus-driven glossary of terms for C-Accel 2019 teams in track A and B with the hope to accelerate convergence on common goals and measures for success. In cases where agreement has not yet been reached or where a plurality of views is beneficial, multiple versions can be maintained and term in a single version may be defined multiple times by indicating which teams utilize them. This will enable teams to interoperate without enforcing a single artificial view._

## Knowledge

A term typically referring to the second concept from the top of a DIKW (Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom ) model pyramid. The term is used to indicate internalized, synthesized, or organized information that can readily be applied, e.g., in domain transfer tasks, and to put new information into perspective. In the context of symbolic representations, the term is often used to contrast methods that aim at making semantics machine-understandable from those that merely operate on a syntactic level.  In the context of [knowledge graphs](#knowledge-graph-kg) and in contrast to epistemology, the term is loosely used to describe statements (about the world) irrespective of whether these statements are factual.

## Knowledge Graph (KG)

A combination of technologies, specifications, and data cultures for densely interconnecting (Web-scale) data across domains in a human and machine readable and reasonable way. The term knowledge graph itself does not prescribe any particular technology stack. The largest publically available knowledge graph is the so-called [Linked Data](#) cloud based on the RDF/[Semantic Web](#) technology stack.

## Open Knowledge Network (OKN)

It may make sense to distinguish between *open-knowledge* networks and open *knowledge-networks*. The first case implies a social structure that provides the means to make [knowledge](#) openly available. The second case, in contrast, describes the structure of the data and the mode of contributions to such structure. To avoid conflicts with the narrower and more technical notion of a [knowledge graph](#knowledge-graph-kg), we define an open knowledge network in the first sense. An OKN is a network consisting of partners across academia, industry, and the government set out to foster the publication, retrieval, and integration of openly available knowledge. Such a network may also foster a culture of opening up otherwise siloed knowledge.
