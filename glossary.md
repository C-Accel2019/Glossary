## AI (Artificial Intelligence)

In contrast to natural intelligence, which is an emergent property of evolved organic life, artificial intelligence is the research field of building machines and programming computers to perform actions that seem intelligent, such as 'learning,' 'problem solving' and '[reasoning](#Reasoning)'. Artificial Intelligence has many subdisciplines, including [Machine Learning], which relies on statistical and mathematical models to analyze data, and [Knowledge Representation], which studies methods and algorithms to encode knowledge (such as in [knowledge graphs](#Knowledge-Graph-KG) and [Ontologies](#Ontology)) by means of formal logic, and to [reason](#Reasoning) over them. In computer science today, one prominent approach to [Machine Learning] uses [Artificial Neural Networks] , which use computational models that are inspired by the behavior of human neurons, and can be trained to solve certain types of problems even in environments that contain noise. Techniques developed from artificial intelligence have been used in applications such as image classification and segmentation, expert systems, language translation, self-driving cars, and more.

## Coreference Resolution

Coreference resolution or instance matching in general is the task of finding all expressions that refer to the same entity in a text. More specifically, in the [Semantic Web](#Semantic-Web) domain, given two [knowledge graphs](#Knowledge-Graph-KG) G1 and G2 as input, instance matching is defined as the process of comparing instance i1 in G1 and instance i2 in G2 based on some similarity measure in order to assess whether i1 and i2 are actually one and the same entity. Usually, the higher the similarity between two instances, the higher is the probability that they actually refer to the same real-world entity.

## Decision Making

Decision making can be regarded as an outcome of mental processes (cognitive process) leading to the selection of a course of action among several alternatives. The output can be an action or an opinion of choice. From a cognitive perspective, the decision making process is a continuous process integrated in the interaction with the environment. From a normative perspective, the analysis of individual decisions is concerned with the logic of decision making and rationality and the invariant choice it leads to. At another level, it might be regarded as a problem solving activity which is terminated when a satisfactory solution is found. Logical decision making is an important part of all science-based professions, where specialists apply their knowledge in a given area to making informed decisions.

## Embedding

In [AI](#AI-Artificial-Intelligence), embeddings refer to the practice of mapping data with a defined vocabulary in high dimensional space to vectors of real numbers in a lower dimensional space. An embedding can represent words, word phrases, sentences, paragraphs, images, sound, entities/relations in a knowledge graph, and so on.

## FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) Data Principles

FAIR is a set of guiding principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.  The term FAIR was launched at a [Lorentz workshop in 2014](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2014/602/info.php3?wsid=602), which produced a set of principles that were [published in 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618).

These include 14 principles and 15 metrics meant to quantify the readiness of data in terms of FAIR.

## GeoAI (Geographic Artificial Intelligence)

GeoAI is the combination of geography and artificial intelligence (AI). GeoAI leverages the state-of-the-art in [AI](#AI-Artificial-Intelligence) to address geospatial challenges, such as weather prediction, land use and land cover mapping, and traffic forecasting. GeoAI also contributes to the [Artificial Intelligence](#AI-Artificial-Intelligence) community by introducing spatiotemporal knowledge into methods design. One example is using spatially-explicit reinforcement learning to summarize places in a knowledge graph.

## GIR (Geographic Information Retrieval)

Geographic information retrieval or geographical information retrieval is an extension of information retrieval with geographic information. GIR aims at solving textual queries that are best approached from a geographical perspective, such as "How many earthquakes occurred from January to March last year in California?". It is common in GIR to separate the text indexing and analysis from the geographic indexing. Semantic similarity and word-sense disambiguation are important components of GIR. To identify place names, GIR often relies on gazetteers, a geographical dictionary or directory used in conjunction with a map or atlas.

## Geospatial Interoperability

Interoperability measures the ability of different computer systems to communicate and access, exchange, integrate, and (re)use data and other resources autonomously without human intervention. Geospatial Interoperability deals with the interoperability among geospatial systems, and software in particular. Standardization is a typical means to achieve interoperability. For instance, the International Standardization Organization (ISO) has defined a series of metadata standards (ISO 19115, ISO 19139) to standardize the organization of metadata. And the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has developed a wide range of web service specifications to define a standardized interface for the representation, retrieval and parsing of geospatial data of various types.

## Knowledge

A term typically referring to the second concept from the top of a DIKW (Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom) model pyramid. The term is used to indicate internalized, synthesized, organized, or familiar information that can readily be applied, for instance, in domain transfer tasks, and used to put new information into perspective. In the context of symbolic representations, the term is often used to contrast methods that aim at making semantics machine-understandable from those that merely operate on a syntactic level.  In the context of [knowledge graphs](#knowledge-graph-kg) and in contrast to epistemology, the term is loosely used to describe statements (about the world) irrespective of whether these statements are factual.

## Knowledge Graph (KG)

A combination of technologies, specifications, and data cultures for densely interconnecting (Web-scale) data across domains in a human and machine readable and reasonable way. The term knowledge graph itself does not prescribe any particular technology stack. More formally, a knowledge graph (as a set of statements) can be thought of as a node and edge labeled directed multigraph. The largest publicly available knowledge graph is the so-called [Linked Data](#Linked-Data) cloud based on the [RDF](#RDF-Resource-Description-Framework)/[Semantic Web](#Semantic-Web) technology stack.

## Knowledge Graph Schema

A Knowledge Graph Schema informs the structure of a [knowledge graph](#Knowledge-Graph-KG). It can be expressed, for instance, by means of an [ontology](#Ontology) using  [OWL](#OWL-Web-Ontology-Language), or the SHACL Shapes Constraint Language, both of which are W3C standards. Knowledge Graph Schemas can often be understood to be knowledge graphs of classes (types) and their relationships.

## Link Prediction

Link Prediction is a field of research aimed at identifying missing relationships (labeled edges) in [knowledge graphs](#Knowledge-Graph-KG). Link Prediction typically includes entity prediction, which is to predict the subject given the relation and the object, or to predict the object given the subject and the relation. It can also involve relation prediction, which aims to predict possible relations between two entities. [Knowledge graph embedding](#Embedding) techniques are a widely studied approach to Link Prediction.

## Linked Data

Linked data currently constitutes the largest publicly available [knowledge graph](#Knowledge-Graph-KG), expressed using W3C standards [RDF](#RDF-Resource-Description-Framework) and [OWL](#OWL-Web-Ontology-Language). The [Semantic Web](#Semantic-Web) field has been creating linked data since about 2007. https://lod-cloud.net/ lists over 1,200 interconnected [knowledge graphs](#Knowledge-Graph-KG) which are publicly accessible. A count from 2015 identified over 37 billion [RDF](#RDF-Resource-Description-Framework) triples, i.e., node-edge-node [knowledge graph](#Knowledge-Graph-KG) statements which could be retrieved from the World Wide Web.

## Ontology

A shared domain model usually expressed using the W3C standard [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](#OWL-Web-Ontology-Language). [OWL](#OWL-Web-Ontology-Language) can be serialized in [RDF](#RDF-Resource-Description-Framework), that is, an [OWL](#OWL-Web-Ontology-Language) document that can be understood to be a [knowledge graph](#Knowledge-Graph-KG) of classes (types) and their relationships. Ontologies can constitute [knowledge graph schemas](#Knowledge-Graph-Schema).

## Ontology Alignment

[Ontology](#Ontology) alignment (also called ontology matching or Knowledge graph Schema[Knowledge Graph Schema](#Knowledge-Graph-Schema) matching aims at finding correspondences between semantically related entities of different [ontologies](#Ontology). These correspondences may be equivalences between entities, but may also be other relations, such as subsumption or disjointness, between ontology entities. [Ontology](#Ontology) entities considered are usually the named entities in ontologies, such as classes, properties or individuals. However, these entities may also be more complex expressions, such as logical ontology axioms, concept definitions, queries or term building expressions. Ontology matching results, called alignments, can thus express with various degrees of precision the relations between the ontologies under consideration. Therefore, ontology alignment can be used for various tasks involving data integration, such as ontology merging, query answering, data translation or for browsing the [Semantic Web](#Semantic-Web). For example, a library can take advantage of alignments for automatically ordering a book and the seller can use them for checking the availability of a reference by the library. Matching ontologies enable the knowledge and data expressed in the matched ontologies to interoperate. It is thus of importance for applications which rely on integrated data.

## Open Knowledge Network (OKN)

It may make sense to distinguish between *open-knowledge* networks and open *knowledge-networks*. The first case implies a social structure that provides the means to make [knowledge](#Knowledge) openly available. The second case, in contrast, describes the structure of the data and the mode of contributions to such structure. To avoid conflicts with the narrower and more technical notion of a [knowledge graph](#knowledge-graph-kg), we define an open knowledge network in the first sense. An OKN is a network consisting of partners across academia, industry, and the government set out to foster the publication, retrieval, and integration of openly available knowledge. Such a network may also foster a culture of opening up otherwise silo-ed knowledge.

## OWL (Web Ontology Language)

A W3C standard for expressing [ontologies](#Ontology), in particular as [knowledge graph schemas](#Knowledge-Graph-Schema). [OWL](#OWL-Web-Ontology-Language) can be serialized in [RDF](#RDF-Resource-Description-Framework), that is, an [OWL](#OWL-Web-Ontology-Language) document that can be understood to be a [knowledge graph](#Knowledge-Graph-KG) of classes (types) and their relationships. [OWL](#OWL-Web-Ontology-Language) is based on description logic, which essentially is a decidable sublanguage of first-order predicate logic. As such, [OWL](#OWL-Web-Ontology-Language) allows for logical (deductive) [reasoning](#Reasoning), and an [OWL](#OWL-Web-Ontology-Language) document together with an ([RDF](#RDF-Resource-Description-Framework)) knowledge graph constitute a knowledge base in the sense used in the subfield of [Artificial Intelligence](#AI-Artificial-Intelligence) known as "Knowledge Representation and Reasoning". For standards documents, see  https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/

## Question Answering

In the field of [natural language processing], Question Answering (QA) refers to the methods, processes, and systems which allow users to ask questions in the form of natural language sentences and receive one or more answers, often in the form of
sentences. Almost all QA systems answer a given question based on their internal [knowledge bases] (KB). According to the nature of such knowledge bases, current QA research can be classified into three categories: unstructured data-based QA (e.g. QA systems based on unstructured text), semi-structure table-based QA (e.g. QA systems based on tables from Wikipedia pages without any schema information), and structured-KB-based QA (so-called [semantic parsing]). In the field of [Semantic Web](#Semantic-Web), question answering over [knowledge graphs](#Knowledge-Graph-KG) is considered as one type of structured-KB-based QA which aims at translating a natural language question into a machine understandable program.

## RDF (Resource Description Framework)

The Resource Description Framework is a W3C standard (2004; revised 2012) for expressing [linked data](#Linked-Data) and [knowledge graphs](#Knowledge-Graph-KG). A corresponding [knowledge graph schema](#Knowledge-Graph-Schema) can be expressed as an [ontology](#Ontology) in [OWL](#OWL-Web-Ontology-Language). A [knowledge graph](#Knowledge-Graph-KG) is expressed in RDF as a set of RDF triples, that is, of node-edge-node relations in the [knowledge graph](#Knowledge-Graph-KG). Nodes and edges are identified using IRIs. As part of the RDF standard, RDF Schema provides vocabulary for node and edge types (called classes) and simple relationships between them. For more complex relationships, the Web Ontology Language [OWL](#OWL-Web-Ontology-Language) can be used. For standards documents, see https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/

## Reasoning

Computational reasoning can come in many forms, and the term is often used ambiguously. The W3C [Semantic Web](#Semantic-Web) standards [RDF](#RDF-Resource-Description-Framework) and [OWL](#OWL-Web-Ontology-Language) natively support *deductive* reasoning, which is based on formal logic and logical consequences which can be derived from given facts, rules, and/or other statements made in formal logic. For instance, given the statement "*Black Beauty* is a horse", and the statement "every horse is a mammal", we can arrive at the logical consequence that "*Black Beauty* is a mammal". The example just given can be expressed in [RDF](#RDF-Resource-Description-Framework), and the [RDF](#RDF-Resource-Description-Framework) standard prescribes this kind of reasoning. The Web Ontology Language [OWL](#OWL-Web-Ontology-Language) can be used to express more complex relationships that can then also be used for deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is a prominent method in some subfields of [Artificial Intelligence)](#AI-Artificial-Intelligence), in particular in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning.

## Representation Learning
The aim of representation learning is to learn representations of data that make it easy for [machine learning] models to extract information for different downstream tasks. In contrast to features harvested by labor-intensive feature engineering, these representations are automatically learned by different well-designed [machine learning]/[deep learning] methods. Good representations of data are expected to convey human priors about the world. For instance, some representations can be shared across tasks. This means a learned representation should be able to capture most of the information hidden in the data, even if it is distributed. Representation learning can disentangle underlying explanatory factors in deep and abstract ways.

## Semantic Interoperability

Semantic interoperability focuses on the semantic understanding of data and software for better and smarter data integration and synthesis. Common interoperable solutions define the syntax for structuring a dataset or invoking an operation, that is, what are the inputs, outputs, and number of parameters. Semantic interoperability moves interoperability up to the next level, where different computer systems not only agree on a protocol to exchange data, but also have a shared understanding of the semantics. Semantic interoperability is achieved by machine reasoning on top of a controlled, shared vocabulary, or an [ontology](#Ontology) is used to annotate data and is encoded in machine-understandable formats, such as [RDF](#RDF-Resource-Description-Framework) or [OWL](#OWL-Web-Ontology-Language).

## Semantic Web

A field of research concerned with developing methods and tools for efficient data sharing, discovery, integration, and reuse. The community is strongly aligned with W3C standards such as [RDF](#RDF-Resource-Description-Framework), [OWL](#OWL-Web-Ontology-Language) and SPARQL for expressing and manipulating [knowledge graphs](#Knowledge-Graph-KG). [Linked Data](#Linked-Data) emerged from the Semantic Web, which constitutes the largest public [knowledge graph](#Knowledge-Graph-KG) that is currently available.

## Spatial Decision Support

Spatial decision support is the computational or informational assistance for making better informed decisions about problems with a geographic or spatial component. This support assists with the development, evaluation and selection of proper policies, plans, scenarios, projects, interventions, or solution strategies. Spatial decision making faces various decision complexities such as:

- Spatial nature and temporal development of phenomena and processes;
- Complex multi-dimensional and heterogeneous data describing decision situations; 
- Large or extremely large data sets that include data in numerical, map, image, text, and other forms; 
- Large number of available alternatives or a need to generate decision alternatives "on the fly" according to the changing situation; 
- Multiple participants with different and often conflicting interests; 
- Multiple categories of knowledge involved, including expert knowledge and layman knowledge.
