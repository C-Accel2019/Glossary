# Glossary
*This living document serves as a community and consensus-driven glossary of terms for C-Accel 2019 teams in track A and B with the hope to accelerate convergence on common goals and measures for success. In cases where agreement has not yet been reached or where a plurality of views is beneficial, multiple versions can be maintained and term in a single version may be defined multiple times by indicating which teams utilize them. This will enable teams to interoperate without enforcing a single artificial view.*
